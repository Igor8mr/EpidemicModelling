Covid deterministic simulation
    Matrix with:
        Different stages with different symptoms, transmission and death rates
            S:  
            I1: Initial infection   - High death rate and low transmission rate
            I2: Fever               - High death rate and high transmission Rate
            I3: Final stage         - Low transmission rate and low death rate
            R:  Recovered/vaccinated, but can still reinfect
            D: 
        Different age group
            Y: Young people - Fast recovery - mostly from I1 to R
            A: Adults 
            E: Elderly

Similar malaria simulation
    Change different age groups to different genetics
